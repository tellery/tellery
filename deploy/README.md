# Deploy Tellery

There are two ways to setup Tellery:

1. [Using Docker Compose](https://tellery.io/docs/getting-started/quick-setup) (locally)
2. [Using Helm](https://tellery.io/docs/getting-started/production-setup) (on Kubernetes)

Using docker-compose is a quick way to tryout Tellery. It brings up all the necessary infrastructure locally. Please check [Quick Setup](https://tellery.io/docs/getting-started/quick-setup) for details.

If you want to setup Tellery in the production environment, we recommend you using Helm to deploy Tellery on Kubernetes. Please check [Production Setup](https://tellery.io/docs/getting-started/production-setup) for details.

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, please [contact us](mailto:contact@tellery.io) to get help.
