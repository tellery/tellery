# For Developers

## Database

We use [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) as ORM framework. Thus you can use all commands supported by TypeORM to operate database.

The following are some common database operations during the development process.

- [Update Entities](./update-entities.md)

## Others

- [Third Party Development](./third-party.md)
