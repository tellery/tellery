Tellery allows you abstract essential data transformation/business logic, and reuse it in future contexts through metrics. Metrics are maintainable and shareable data models across dashboards and reports. They are defined consistently and always up to date.


To deliver better value of the metrics, Tellery comes with a bucket of building blocks and rich text styling features. Want a real-time dashboard? A feature-specific analysis? An anomalies investigation? You can tailor it to your need to unlock the value of data.


## Features

- Declare data transformation/metrics using SQL and reuse them everywhere
- Familiar notebook interface where you can organize charts and texts with drag-and-drop ease
- A modern SQL editor with multi-tabs and auto-complete
- Write analytical narratives using Markdown syntax
- Capture exploratory analyses and associate them with bi-directional links
- Collaborate and review work in real-time with multiplayer
