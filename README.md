Tellery is a BI tool connecting your data and team. As easy as using a notebook. As powerful as a data modelling tool.


Instead of querying on tables and columns directly, Tellery users can operate on [data assets](https://demo.tellery.io/story/vtkequmHGz5QBD9WjVflU), which are well-maintained models in your workspace. It makes your metrics more consistent and easier to maintain. 


To deliver better value of the data assets, Tellery comes with a notebook interface and a bucket of building blocks. From reports to dashboards, you can tailor it to your need to unlock the value of data.


## Features

- Familiar notebook interface where you can create charts and texts with drag-and-drop ease
- Declare data assets using SQL and reuse them everywhere 
- Integrate with dbt repository and import dbt models as data assets
- A modern SQL editor with multi-tabs and auto-complete
- Write analytical narratives using Markdown syntax
- Capture exploratory analyses and associate them with bi-directional links
- Collaborate and review work in real-time with multiplayer


## Supported databases

- [Officially supported connectors](https://tellery.io/docs/available-connectors)
- [Community-supported connectors](https://github.com/tellery/community-supported-connectors)
