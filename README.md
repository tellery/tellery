Tellery helps data teams to organize ad-hoc analyses and narrate them in one place.

Tellery brings all of your words and data into one flexible surface:

- [x] ü§ñ Anomalies investigation
- [x] üìù Feature-specific analysis
- [x] üìä Campaign-oriented dashboard
- [x] üôå Or customize your deliverable for your own needs

Tellery allows you to abstract essential business logic, and reuse it in future contexts. You can define a model grasping the nuances of datasets to make exploratory analysis organizable. Tellery uses SQL to model data, so you can easily consolidate it in dbt.
