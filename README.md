Tellery comes with a bucket of lego-ish building blocks. From [dashboards](https://demo.tellery.io/story/L7LxDbPpXCL4BQ9QHx6T4) to reports, you can customize it to your needs. Tellery users can ask questions against [Data assets](https://demo.tellery.io/story/vtkequmHGz5QBD9WjVflU) instead of communicating in only tables and columns. Data assets provide a central business abstraction over your data.


- [x] üíé Let business users get answers in just a few clicks. Tellery will automatically rollup the metrics on the fly.
- [x] üìè Delivering insights through data assets makes your metrics consistent and easy to maintain.
- [x] üí™ Data assets can also be incorporated into deep analyses with SQL.



## Features

- Familiar notebook interface where you can create charts and texts with drag-and-drop ease
- Rich text styling and markdown syntax for telling a story
- A modern SQL editor with multi-tabs and auto-complete
- Reference data assets or another question like CTEs
- Capture ad-hoc analyses like taking notes
- Review work and collaborate in real-time with multiplayer
- Import dbt models and sources and inspect their metadata while editing SQL


## Supported databases

- [Officially supported connectors](https://tellery.io/docs/available-connectors)
